"Build, release, run" is the foundation of every software delivery practice.

With Docker installed on your development machine, you now have the tools to move this build process to the very beginning of the development cycle. This shift enables you to:

* Manage all your app dependencies in code
* Build a single image that works for development, testing and production

So your very first step is to [build images](/guide/images/).
