You just configured your app so that you can Develop it locally. The next goal is to get it ready for customers. This requires:

* Provisioning a Rack
* Provisioning a production-ready Database
* Releasing your app
* Scaling your app Services
* Adding a custom domain
* Configuring a certificate

The command is:

<pre class="terminal">
<span class="command">convox deploy</span>
</pre>

But first you need to set up your cloud environment. You can start by [provisioning a Rack](/guide/racks/).
