It’s a big week for hiring.

Bob is starting as the newest developer, and Alice is starting on the security team. You, the engineering manager, are responsible for helping them to deploy the first bug fix and to roll out the latest Linux kernel with a critical security fix.

So you...

* Sign into the AWS IAM management console

* Create new IAM users and access keys for ‘alice’ and ‘bob’

* Look at the IAM policies and groups. Is Alice ready for ‘Administrator’ access? Should Bob be in the ‘Devs’, ‘DevOps’, or ‘DevOps 2016’ group? Why are Bob’s peers all ‘Administrators’?

* Review the policy bodies. Is this correct and safe? Who maintains this these days?

* Send AWS Access Keys to Alice and Bob

Now Alice and Bob can read the engineering docs, and use `aws` CLI and the web management console to poke around and change things.

Careful, don’t break anything!

## The Convox Way

A couple months ago your team adopted Convox as a way to simplify all your infrastructure and apps.

So you...

* Sign into the Convox Console

* Invite Bob into a **Developer Role** and Alice into an **Operator Role**

Now Alice and Bob can follow the invite, get their API key, and use the `convox` CLI to deploy apps or manage infrastructure.

Bob doesn’t have any access to the AWS account or ability to perform sensitive actions to the Convox infrastructure. 

Alice doesn’t have access to the AWS account, and all her actions are automated behind tools like `convox rack update` and `convox rack scale` and are designed for zero-downtime.

A whole class of security and reliability problems are no longer a concern.

## Convox Role-Based Access Control

With Convox, all of your team deploys apps and manages infrastructure through a simple [REST API](https://convox.com/api) and the `convox` CLI. The API now has role-based access control (RBAC) baked in.

When team members are put in roles, they get restricted access to just the APIs they need for app development vs. operations. Their API keys let them get the job done without the risk of accessing (or breaking) anything outside of their job responsibility.

**Developers** are limited to working with apps:

* Create new apps

* Deploy to apps

* Scale apps

* Debug app processes

* View app logs

While **Operators** can perform infrastructure actions:

* Apply AMI security updates 

* SSH to instances

* Scale up to larger instances

* Connect to private databases

**Administrators** can do everything, as well as invite new team members and modify roles.

## Constraints Are Powerful

The Convox API and the **Administrator**, **Operator** and **Developer** roles are extremely simple by design.

We hope that with Convox and these roles, you, Alice and Bob can quickly and safely get your jobs done on day one without worrying about IAM configuration and AWS service APIs.

You can read the **[Access Control Docs](https://convox.com/docs/rbac/)** to learn more about how it all works.

We’d love to  get your feedback on Role-based Access Control on [Slack](http://invite.convox.com/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/convox/rack).
